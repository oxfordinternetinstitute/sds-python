    "Actually, you can cheat a little bit here and not even have an init statement, but in that case, it is created implicitly. Init is the method that is run whenever you create a new object of that class type. If you have program that creates tweets for processing, then putting things in the init (such as when you created the tweet) will then be available for later. "
