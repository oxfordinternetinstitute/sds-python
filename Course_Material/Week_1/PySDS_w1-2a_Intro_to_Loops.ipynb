    "_Author's note:_ This lecture was not given but drafted in response to the original lecture on loops. While much is covered in that lecture, this will be far more explicit in detailing what happens in a loop. Some concepts are only outlined here that are used elsewhere, such as ```continue``` and ```break```, so it is worth reviewing. "

    "The purpose of using loops is to do something in particular to each item in a collection of items. If you have multiple items in a collection, you will often want to operate on all of the items. This is typically accomplished by going over the items one-by-one. We call this process 'looping'. As a verb we would _loop_ over a collection, but also as a noun, would refer to 'the loop' as the set of iterations. So we could _loop_ over a collection of items but also if we stop halfway through because of an error we have just broke the _loop_.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are a foundational, crucial part of programming. In fact, much of programming really comes down to iterating through collections of things and doing something with each element under some condition. Often we put layers of abstraction on top of this process, but this process is pretty much the universal one. In fact, British mathematician Alan Turing demonstrated that, loosely speaking, any mechanism by which we can take a list, do something for some of the cases and remember where we are can do any computation. Formally this is referred to as the [univerisal computing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine), but it is often called a Turing machine after its creator/discoverer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterating using a ```for``` loop. \n",
    "Sometimes the collection is ordered, such as a ```list```, and sometimes the collection is unordered, such as a ```set``` or a ```dictionary```. Regardless, you are able to perform some action with each element of the collection and know that once you've finished you've iterated through every element of the collection. The process of going through the items is called **iterating**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way to iterate through a collection in python is to use a \"for\" loop. It is called a \"for\" loop because we use it to do something for each element in a collection. In fact, the way it is written is meant to be similar to written English. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we iterate through the collection, it is convention to use the letter ```i``` to stand in as a variable representing each of the collection as we operate on it one at a time. So in code you will typically see code in a pattern like the following: \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "for i in range(n):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we use a function called range. It creates a list of numbers from ```0``` up to and including ```n```. To do something one hundred times you would write ```range(100)``` and it would return an object that operates like a list with a hundred elements, ```[0,1,2...99,100]```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a language that uses the spacing of the characters to represent semantics. In this case, we have the idea of being 'inside' something or 'outside'. Being 'inside' a ```for``` loop means that we are doing some action for each element of the collection. So for each element in the range one to one hundred we would print the number. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to do something for some items in the collection but not others, we would use an ```if``` statement. This similarly uses spacing to denote what to do in that condition. So if we only want to print multiples of five we can use the if statement to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    if i%5==0:\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case the %5 means modulus 5 or \"get the remainder of dividing by 5\". What is the remainder of dividing by five? Just have a look by running the code below: "

    "- **Yield**: This is when we return a result but next time we call a function it starts back where it was in the loop rather than starting from the beginning. \n",
    "- **Generators**: This is what you call a function with a yield statement in it. Generators are covered in the next course.\n",
    "- **Creating an iterator**: This is how you can make your own data structures iterable. You might create your own ```class``` of object and then want to call it directly in a for loop. This is an extended topic found online.\n",
    "- **Halting problem**: This is a [well known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) proof in computer science to  help reflect on when a loop can finish, if ever. It's an extremely tricky idea, but also very profound as it shows the limits of computability. It is, some have argued, roughly equivalent to Godel's landmark incompleteness theorem but the halting problem is demonstrated using an algorithm."
