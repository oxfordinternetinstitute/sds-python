    "The numpy array is the basis of the series and data frame objects. It is very efficient. Unlike a list, the objects in an array are of the same type. This allows for considerably faster computation. Here it is worth pointing out that much of python is actually a wrapper for ```c``` code. C is a pervasive, extremely efficient language. That said, it is often cumbersome to use and does not provide anywhere near the level of abstraction of python. Numpy uses C more directly than python lists do.  \n",

We will show this in Section 3. \n",

What if we had a way to determine whether a friendship is reciprocated? This is where ```numpy``` shines as a means of doing **linear algebra**. \n",
    " - As we go through this example, it will be clear that not only is matrix algebra useful, but that it can be hard to follow without having labels on the rows and columns. So first let's do it, and then we will move over to the nicer data structures with labels.\n"

If you call a DataFrame with something in the indexer such as ```df[\"data\"]``` you are accessing the the ```data``` column. Like a series, the DataFrame has a notion of whether it is all of the same type or a mix of different types. \n",

You can slice a DataFrame. The result is a 'view' of the DataFrame. That is to say, in many cases, with DataFrames you will not be creating a completely new DataFrame in memory. This is to help with memory management, but it can have some knock on effects. This will become relevant later when we start grouping data. First, let's create a single DataFrame."
