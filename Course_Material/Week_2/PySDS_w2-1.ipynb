    "The numpy array is the basis of the series and data frame objects. It is very efficient. Unlike a list, the objects in an array are of the same type. This allows for considerably faster computation. Here it is worth pointing out that much of python is actually a wrapper for ```c``` code. C is a pervasive, extremely efficiet language. That said, it is often cumbersome to use and does not provide anywhere near the level of abstraction of python. Numpy uses c more directly than python lists do.  \n",

    "We tend not to use ethe numpy array directly although it can be useful for a number of tricks, as we will show later. One in particular is for generating multiple columns of random numbers. However, for the most part we only interface numpy through PANDAS and not directly. \n",

    " - It's not very clear who is who in this matrix. We know that it goes Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diane so we can follow along. But that gets particularly difficult when we have many rows and columns we have to manage. Part of the reason for using PANDAS is that where an array is simplified, a PANDAS DataFrame allows us to have row and column labels, as well as indexing by that label. We will show this in a minute. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The semantics:\n",
    " - Notice that we said this was a network of friendships. Well, aren't friends supposed to be symmetric? Bob said Alice was his friend, but Alice did not say Bob was her friend. Drama! What if we had a way to determine whether a friendship is reciprocated? This is where ```numpy``` shines as a means of doing **linear algebra**. \n",
    " - As we go through this example, it will be clear that not only is matrix algebra useful, but that it can be hard to follow without having labels on the rows and columns. So first let's do it, and then we will move over to the nicer data structures with labels.\n"

    "1. To do this we would first flip the matrix around. Right now we have it so that we have rows of 'from' and columns of 'to'. So it is a row of friendship nominations from Alice to Bob, Charlie and Diane. By **transposing**  we can turn this on its head so that it 'to' in the columns and 'from' in the rows.\n",
