Obviously, we could have just split on the tab character in this particular instance, but it's the logic of specifying regexs that's important, such as saying \"all digits\" or \"one or more digits plus a comma.\" In the parentheses for the regular expression we can either ask for 0,1,n or a predetermined number of characters. The characters can be in a range, such as 0-9 or a-z. But we can also use escape codes for the characters. See below for examples of regexs with text.  \n",
